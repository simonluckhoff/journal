Things to add:
- Password protect journal entries
- how to make shortcuts on my page? cmmd+t to make new note. 
- have buttons next to each other on viewing pages. 





Quick Entry:
We've made some really good progress: can delete, edit, create, return home. 
Ui is also looking banging. Think i"d just wanna standardize the buttons, one class for all. 
But there are some things I still wanna add. Only thing I didnt think through was that the moment I start jounralling in it, people will be able to see my entries... not so private then.
